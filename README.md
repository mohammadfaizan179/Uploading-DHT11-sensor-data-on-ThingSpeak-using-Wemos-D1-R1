# Uploading-DHT11-sensor-data-on-ThingSpeak-using-Wemos-D1-R1
This mini-project is to Uploading the temperature and Humidity of DHT11 sensor ThingSpeak using Wemos D1 R1

Explanation:
	
--> First we must have required components
	(1)Wemos D1 R2 Mini
	(2)DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
	(3)BreadBorad (optional)
	(4)Jumper Wires	

--> Make the circuit diagram shown in the diagram attached file

--> To program WeMOS D1 R2 using arduino IDE and its programming language we have to add add-on for the arduino IDE 
	--> Start Arduino and open Preferences window.
	--> Enter https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json into Additional Board Manager URLs field.
	--> Open Boards Manager from Tools > Board menu and find esp8266 platform.
	--> Select the version you need from a drop-down box.
	--> Click install button.

--> Connect the WeMOS to the internet i.e using Hotspot of your mobile 

--> Upload the Code provided in the arduino attached file.

--> Connect your WeMOS with ThingSpeak using apiWritekey to write the sensor data that is done in the code part already

--> Upload the code

--> Analyze the result
